*Conference*: Trends in Language Teaching International Conference

*Abstract*: Although language teaching has been attracting scholarly attention
in the academia, most research synthesises are qualitative in nature, which
entails the quantitative counterpart to complement the validity of the findings.
Therefore, to facilitate our understanding of the intellectual landscape of the
research in language teaching, based on 1495 research articles published in the
journals indexed by SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) between 2000 and 2020,
the present study analysed the research trend via the scientometric study
software CiteSpace. The findings display that the number of publications in this
field witnessed a rapid increase since 2008, which was led by the USA, the UK,
and Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. The bursts analysis and cluster analysis
exhibited three primary research trends in the past 20 years: (1) the transfer
of attention from classroom education to computer-assisted language learning;
(2) the reorientation from general English education to ESP (English for
Specific Purposes) education; and (3) the change of concentration from teacher
(e.g., teacher training and pedagogy) to learner (e.g., individual differences
and collaborative learning). Other valuable results and implications were
discussed as well, such as the lack of cross-country collaboration. These
results perfect the existent research synthesis from a quantitative perspective.
