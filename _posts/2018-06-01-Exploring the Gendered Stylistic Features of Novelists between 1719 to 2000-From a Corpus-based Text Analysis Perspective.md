**Introduction**

Referring to an early work on feminism, Lakoff (1973) hypothesised that women
utilised a distinctive unique language with weakness, ambiguity, and
irrationality which entitled *Deficit Theory*. After this activation of the
gender-based investigation, abundant empirical and non-empirical research was
conducted which established *Dominance, Difference, and Dynamics Theories*
(Gumperz, 1982; West & Zimmerman, 1983). The former two paradigms attribute the
dissimilar language practice between genders to the distinct social status and
differences between male and female community respectively. The latter one
indicates that females do not permanently possess a characteristic speech but
deliberately or unconsciously employ a specific tongue under certain social
background to *feminise* themselves. In this respect, linguists also conducted
examinations on evaluating diverse discourse usage of different genders, for
instances, the frequency of conveying logical sentences, utilising *prestige*
(standard) and *stigma* (vernacular) language, expressing emotions, exhibiting
politeness (Bucholtz, 2004). Based on these outcomes, focusing on analysing
literature works using corpus tool, this research will detect the different
writing styles of male and female discourse.

The following related research questions will be covered in this report:

1.  Are these two subgroups of writers possess different ability to produce
    logical sentences?

2.  Are these two subgroups of writers use the prestige language and stigma
    language differently?

3.  Are these two subgroups of writers apply distinct styles, like certain
    gender-excluded and gender-preferred language, to convey information?

**Method**

According to a brief history of English literature (Blamires, 2013), 30 novels
comprising 15 male works and 15 female ones were manually selected. The texts
are primarily from Project Gutenberg (Hart, 2016) and also some were transcribed
from their hard-copies. Additionally, three chapters of most novella were
randomly chosen applying the Random Number Table, meanwhile, for short novels,
whole texts or comparatively more ratio of the texts was excerpted. In
scrutinising these data, WordSmith Tool, the Prime Machine, and Multidimensional
Analysis Tagger were operated to generate the corpus data.

Chart A: basic corpus statistics (using the Prime Machine)

To moderate the individual differentiations especially the social ideology in
the certain historical period and topic choices of two genders, the publishing
time and subgenre were considered. For example, as shown in *Chart A*, the
novels published before and after the feminism movement were included.
Furthermore, comparatively comprehensive subgenres were selected for both male
writing and female writing. It is also assumed that the unobservable educational
background discrepancy of those renowned novelists will not sway the results.
Nevertheless, limitations also exist such as the asymmetrical tokens triggered
by the varied chapter lengths of different authors. In addition, the selection
of novels may harbour several drawbacks due to the excessive complexity of
striking a balance between the representativeness and the range of subgenre.

To evaluate the capability of delivering logical sentences, a framework as
*Chart B* constructed by Jespersen (2013) was adopted to reckon the *parataxis*
(clauses linked by coordinating conjunctions) and *hypotaxis* (clauses linked by
subordinating conjunctions) patterns. It is supposed that hypotaxis possesses an
explicit logical relation but parataxis does not (*ibid*.).

|                           | Parataxis         | hypotaxis                              |
|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Typically found in        | Anglo-Saxon prose | Renaissance and post-renaissance prose |
|                           | Speech            | Writing                                |
| Supposed to be typical of | Restricted code   | Elaborated code                        |
|                           | Women’s language  | Men’s language                         |

Chart B: the linguistic domains of parataxis and hypotaxis

As *Chart C* presented, the parataxis and hypotaxis patterns, identified by the
coordinating conjunctions tag (ANDC) and diversified subordinating conjunctions
tags (CAUS, CONC, COND, OSUB, PASTP, PIRE, PRESP, SERE, THATD, TOBJ, and TSUB)
of MAT, reveals that males employ more parataxis terms which implies that they
utilise comparatively more unreasoned sentences.

|                  | Total    |
|------------------|----------|
| Male parataxis   | 1.737333 |
| Female parataxis | 1.487333 |
|                  | Total    |
| Male hypotaxis   | 1.492667 |
| Female hypotaxis | 1.627333 |

Chart C: the parataxis and hypotaxis patterns ratio of two corpora

In investigating the prestige and stigma language selection of female and male
writers, the written texts are less representative than conversational
discourses as the stigma patterns of language are always edited out by authors
and editors. However, the relatively informal or less formal discourse
preference can be exposed by keyword as well. The key keyword of female corpus
against male one was calculated manifested by *Chart D*. It seems that female
writers will use more contractions regarded as colloquial form and less formal
form of language, which is also confirmed by *Chart E*.

Chart E: the contraction utilisation searched by MAT

For the interesting terms “Mrs.” and “Mr.” in the keyword list, a comparable
*Chart F* was composed to display the contrast between these two subgroups.
Based on this chart, the females’ novels perhaps comprise more American books
using “Mr.” and “Mrs.” containing a period but not the form without a period.
The total number diversity of "Mrs." And "Mrs" may be solely because there are
more female characters in female writing. Subsequently, it does not represent
that female writers incline to utilise prestige especially super-polite
formations.

Chart F: American and British formation of Mr. and Mrs.

The number of adjectives were counted by MAT as well. As indicated by *Chart G*,
male novelists employ more amplifiers like greatly but women more emphatic terms
like any form of DO followed by a verb. Although this disparity is relatively
insignificant, the outcome that females apply more colloquial language can
possibly be obtained.

Chart G: the comparison of amplifiers and emphatics

To further explore the writing style of these two sub-corpora, the frequency of
hedges was calculated since Lakoff (1973) claimed that women tend to exploit
hedges to avoid prevent being masculine and over-assertive. If only perceiving
the mean and total number in *Chart H*, it seems that female apply more hedges.
However, in the female corpus, No. 11 and No. 14 account for nearly 70 percent
hedge employments which are doubted as a biased result. Hence, it is anticipated
that there is no overt divergence between male and female authors in this
regard.

Chart H: The comparison of hedges

Conversely, as displayed by *Chart I*, females appear to utilise less uncertain
words which means they present more assured information. In the same chart, it
is realised that male writers possibly use more positive terms.

Positive:

Chart I: Positive, Negative, Uncertainty word comparison

Moreover, as *Chart J* shows, the term “because” which reveals a strong logical
connection is a keyword in female corpus against male one. In the same chart,
apart from the characters’ name and the other terminologies, it appears that
“castle”, “bird”, “aunt”, “bedroom” and “child” are special in the female
writing. After observing the concordance line, “castle”, “bird” and “aunt” are
attested to be produced by the topics, for example, almost all the “castle” are
from the same novel *The Bloody Chamber* and the “bird” is a name in *Uncle
Tom’s Cabin*.

Chart J: Keyword-female corpus against male corpus

Similarly, the keyword of male corpus is presented by *Chart K*. Except the
names, the words “answered”, “account”, “company”, “boat”, “arrival”, “any”,
“acquaintance”, “club”, “dare” and “came” appears to be special in this corpus.
However, after examining the concordance line, it is proven that “answered”,
“account”, “company”, “any”, “acquaintance” primarily emerge in *Tome Jones* and
“club” in *This Side of Paradise*. As there are two traveller’s sagas in
male-writer corpus, the term “boat” and “arrival” are considered to be the
irrelevant results created by this certain genre.

Chart L: keyword analysis of five words

**Discussion**

Firstly, it is noticed that male will utilise more so-called illogical forms of
language which refuting Jespersen’s (2013) argument about female using weak and
comparatively irrational language. Males' frequent employment of uncertainty
words also challenges the previous opinions about females acquiring an
uncertain, weak, and unassertive language (Bucholtz, 2004). From these
discoveries, minimising the impact from educational background and social
ideology, it seems unchallenging to affirm that males counterintuitively harbour
certain alleged female writing style. However, a research by Labov (1972)
manifests that considerable educated females will intentionally imitate the
language exploitation of male counterparts to avoid being despising. The results
may symbolise the hypercorrection phenomenon which also emerges in the
Lower-Middle-Class people who studying the prestige language to enhance their
social status.

Moreover, the results exhibit that women will operate more contractions and
other colloquial languages which are acknowledged by multiple researchers.
Generally, this inconsistency appears when the female sample is a low educated
group in which people can rarely access the written text (Coates, 2015).
However, the participants are all high-educated novelists who conflict with the
former findings. Consequently, it is believed that females employ a
comparatively more colloquial style when writing.

Additionally, there are diversified keywords in these two corpora. Apart from
the bias keywords containing names and topic particular words, the males use
"dare" and "came" more, and females use "bedroom" and "child" more. It seems
that the living environment, gender community, and different language immersing
level contribute to these frequent use terms.

The results above may support the research question, nevertheless, the
surprising one is that the majority of results indicate that there is no overt
dissimilarity between these two subcategories. For example, that the hedges
application has trivial distinctions conflicts the belief that women hedge more
(Bucholtz, 2004). There is no differentiation of negative language using but
Lakoff (1972, cited in Talbot, 2010) claims that women tend to utilise the
super-polite form like euphemism to avoid negative meanings. Therefore, it is
believed that only a little difference between different gender writings can be
observed when moderating the living background.

**Conclusion**

This report has investigated the male and female novel writing exploiting corpus
tool. Although some evidence is compatible with the research questions and the
previous research, the majority results appear to verify that there is little
difference between these two corpora which opposes the previous
acknowledgements. However, there are also numerous limitations of this research,
for instance, the moderation of text length, topic, and subgenre selection is
far from perfection which fabricates considerable bias results. Hence, more
reliable and valid research is required in the future.
