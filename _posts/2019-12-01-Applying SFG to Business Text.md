## Introduction

In the realm of contemporary linguistics, scholars investigate language from two
principal perspectives, regarding it as the formal realisation of thoughts (cf.
Chomsky, 1970, 1988) or the system of communication. Different from Chomsky’s
approach which aims to ascertain the biological premise of language processing,
considerable linguists are dedicated to exploring the sociological function of
language in communication (see, Contini-Morava, Kirsner, & Rodriguez-Bachiller,
2004; Halliday, 1978; Langacker, 2001). As *Systemic Functional Grammar*, one of
the central theories in this line of research, can account for three main
meta-functions (experiential, interpersonal, and textual) of language in a
systemic manner (see more in Literature Review section), it will be employed in
the later analysis. Due to the nature of this sociological approach, the texts
being examined will therefore be scrutinised in accordance with the contextual
situations of them.

Register, which is theorised to describe the contextual situations of texts,
receives scholarly attention as it is conducive to the evaluation of text topic
(*field*), addresser-addressee relation (*tenor*), and language organisation
(*mode*) (Eggins, 2004). The focus of the present essay will be on tenor, which
mainly expressed by the interpersonal function of language (Halliday &
Matthiessen, 2014). Therefore, in the following sections, after introducing the
relevant concepts in Systemic Functional Grammar, three business-related texts
with similar field will be analysed to show to what extent the lexicogrammar
choices can reflect the tenor of the context. The analysis, in addition, will
mainly focus on mood and modality system, due to its close relation to tenor
(Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). Nevertheless, it has to be noticed that the
scope will not be restricted to mood analysis, as the function of language is
dynamically fulfilled by all the linguistic evidences simultaneously.

## Literature Review

In the paradigm of Systemic Functional Grammar (henceforth SFG), language is a
semiotic system on the choices of meanings and functions, influenced by
sociocultural contexts (Halliday, 1978). This section will primarily introduce
two main aspects of SFG, tenor and three meta-functions of language, as they are
more relevant to the present study[^1].

[^1]: The discussions on considerable SFG topics such as texture (cohesion and
    coherence), the semiotic nature of language (e.g. arbitrariness), the
    cultural influence on language (e.g. SFG and cross-cultural comparison), and
    the context of culture (e.g. SFG and genre analysis) seem to fall out the
    scope of the present paper. For a more comprehensive understanding on SFG,
    other systematic introductory publications can be resorted to (e.g. Eggins,
    2004; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Thompson, 2013).

Tenor, one of the three register variables, reflects the social relation between
speakers and audience, and its definition has been developed by multiple
scholars (cf. Brown & Gilman, 1972; Ventola, 1995). In the following discussion,
Poynton’s (1985) tripartite model of tenor will be adopted. The first dimension
of this framework is power, illustrating the equality of two interactants.
Secondly, tenor is also about the contact, which indicate the frequency of
interaction. The final part of this model is affective involvement, signifying
the mutual emotional engagement of certain situation. By analysing these
subdimensions of tenor, the present essay will explore how the language reflect
those social roles and fulfil specific interpersonal functions.

In addition, the SFG researchers concluded three main facets of text, the
experiential, interpersonal, and textual meta-functions, which concurrently
construe the meaning of a text (Thompson, 2013). Interpersonal meta-function,
which is the focus of the present paper, is related to the interaction among
people (*ibid*.). In this regard, mainly employing the mood and modality system,
the language was constructed to exchange (giving or demanding) the commodity
(goods-&-services or information) (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). Mood system of
language can be indicative of the basic speech function of utterances. Those
basic speech functions can be further modified with the modality and polarity
system, which defines the continuum between ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ as *modal
space* (Eggins, 2004). Based on this system, four types of modality were
identified including modalisation probability, modalisation usuality, modulation
obligation, modulation inclination, all of which can be realised by modal
operators, mood adjuncts, or sometimes comment adjuncts. Moreover, every
realisation of modality will account for certain modal value, representing the
speakers’ *commitment* to the validity of their utterances. These attitudes are
also organised differently to show the degree of overtness of the
responsibility, vis-à-vis the subjectivity and explicitness of the modality.

The experiential meta-function, mainly constructed by the transitivity system,
is about the propositional content of human experience (Halliday & Matthiessen,
2014). Influenced by the interaction between human and the world, individuals
will formulate their language in six main types including material, behavioural,
mental, verbal, relational, and existential processes. The participants of these
six processes, therefore, will harbour different experiential roles which may
reveal the register feature of the text. Textual meta-function, in addition,
reflects the information organisation of text which mainly presented in the
thematic structure (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014). Through theme analysis, the
researchers may identify how the speakers want the information receivers to
interpret the message (Eggins, 2004).

In the later investigation, mood and modality will be prioritised. Every feature
concluded will be assessed according to the three different dimensions of tenor.
When analysing these texts, all the independent and dependent clauses were
counted as valid data. As argued by Thompson (2013), tense, realised by the
finite as well, is always neutral without attitudinal meaning, and hence would
not be counted as modality in the later analysis. The different text features
will be then evaluated as the reflections of the social role differences in the
context. However, it has to be noticed that, as text can contribute to
construing the context as well (see, Halliday, 1978; Langacker, 2001; Thompson,
2013), it is fairly justifiable to demonstrate that ‘certain language guides the
audience to perceive their social role in a certain way, and hence constructs
certain contextual situation’.

Table 1 presents the main descriptive statistics of mood and modality analysis.
Classifications which are absent in all three texts (e.g. Responsibility:
Subjective Explicit) were excluded from the result table. For the listed
categories, both valid number and percentage were provided to show the accurate
descriptive data. If inferential statistical procedures were used, Cohen’s
(1988) effect size interpretation benchmark was employed to evaluate the result.
The statistically significant level was all set to be *p* = .05. Apart from the
quantitative data presented in Table 1, more detailed analysis of each sentence
was provided in the Appendix for reference.

From the descriptive data, it could be observed that Text 2 distinctly contains
interrogative and imperative clauses, which transfers the audience from the
information receiver to the information demander. This inclusion of interactive
speech enriches the power of the addressees partly because the role of exchange
is pretended to be reciprocal. Due to this deconstruction of role, a high
frequent contact between two interactants is construed and the interaction seems
to be more informal and colloquial. Additionally, the readers can have a high
affective involvement when they seem to be asked to provide information or
services (Eggins, 2004). Comparatively, Text 1 and 3 are predominantly
declarative, which reflects a formal tenor with unequal power, infrequent
contact, and low affective involvement.

Furthermore, compared to the other two texts, Text 2 has more modality most of
which present probability and account for high modal value. Together with the
repeated use of the personal pronoun as subject, the power of the audience was
enhanced and that of the speaker was disguised. The focus of the text became
what the clients will receive but not what the bank should do. Even for the only
modulation demonstrating obligation, passive voice was applied to avoid direct
command. Those efforts on establishing an equal relation also entail the tenor
of frequent contact and high affective involvement. For example, the audience
will engage more into the conversation because they may be guided to accentuate
their own opinions on the product. In addition, as those lexicogrammar choices
may fail to emphasise the service provider, high value of the modality was
exploited to illustrate the high quality and promise of the service.
Differently, Text 1 and 3 seems to employ more polarity to provide factual
knowledge, establishing a formal tenor with unequal power again.

| Table 2: Modality Distribution in Text 1 and 3 |          |          |          |          |
|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|                                                | Text 1   | Text 3   |          |          |
|                                                | Modality | Polarity | Modality | Polarity |
| Independent Clause                             | 0        | 11       | 3        | 14       |
| Dependent Clause                               | 3        | 7        | 0        | 3        |

However, after deeper analysis, the modality used in Text 1 and 3 have been
found to be different as well. From Table 2, it can be observed that modality
distribution of these two texts are distinct. As a news report provider, the
speaker of Text 1 is endowed with the unequal power caused by the information
gap between two interactants, which enables (s)he predominantly employs polarity
in the main independent clauses to introduce facts. In contrast, as a feature
article, the purpose of Text 3 is to develop an attitudinal argument, so the
attitudinal information conveyed by modality was expressed in the main
independent clauses to make the argument more tenable. In this respect, the
value of modality also reveals dissimilar power relationships. The modal values
of Text 1 are high to middle, compared to the low commitment in Text 3. As
discussed above, due to the unequal power of Text 1, the expression can be
exclusively informative, which means that the wordings can be much more
assertive. Differently, the repetitive use of low value modality in Text 3
creates less authoritative tenor, which makes the statement more difficult to
dispute.

The above discussion seems to reveal that Text 1 and 3 construed a more formal
addresser-addressee relationship, but Text 2 a more informal one. Nevertheless,
it should be noticed that considerable efforts were made in Text 2 to maintain
the credibility which may diminish with the informal tenor. Apart from the use
of high modality, Text 2 also exclusively employs *Implicit Objective*
modalisation which was utilised in the other two formal texts as well. Being
objective is conducive to the construction of a tenor with less frequent
contact, which harbours some semblance of formality and may increase the
credibility of the text. With it, the subjective assessment of the speaker was
formulated as a spontaneous process of the nature, disguising the real stance of
the writer. Being implicit, moreover, can mask the responsibility of the
information provider, another potential purpose of Text 2.

The other approach to maintain formality is through lexical density and
diversification, which may fall within the scope of mode. As spoken language
will have a low lexical density (Eggins, 2004), Text 2 which is examined to be
more colloquial should have had a low *type-token ratio*[^2] compared to the
other two more formal texts. However, through the corpus tool *AntConc*
(Anthony, 2014), it is found that in terms of type-token ratio no statistically
significant result can be identified within these three texts (*Chi-Square* =
1.522, *Cremer’s V* = .037, *p* = 0.533). Based on these findings, it may be
concluded that Text 2, to construct the friendly interpersonal relation,
reflects a seemingly informal tenor with equal power, frequent contact, and high
affective involvement, but essentially a formal tenor with the ultimate aim of
delivering information.

[^2]: Type-token ratio is a corpus linguistics concept which means the number of
    types divided by that of tokens (cf. Kettunen, 2014; Richards, 1987). As a
    robust measure of lexical diversification, it will be used to replace the
    lexical density measurement originally used in Eggins’s (2004) work.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this essay has explored the lexicogrammar choices of three
business texts, and showed how these features reflect or construe the tenor
variable. It is found that Text 1 is informative, declarative, and formal, which
aims at providing factual knowledge to the audience. Text 2, differently,
attempts to create an interactive, equal, and affective involving tenor, but
simultaneously maintain the informative nature. That is because the relation
between the bank and clients is dynamically established as information provider
and receiver, service provider and beneficiary, and also profit yielder and
customer. In addition, Text 3 is informative, declarative, and formal just as
Text 1; however, it also aims to make an attitudinal argument which leads the
speaker to use modality in a different manner.

Limited by length, the present essay fails to provide a more detailed and valid
analysis on those three texts. Although the specific emphasis on mood and
modality system enhances the understanding of interpersonal meta-function which
is important for tenor analysis, more aspects should be considered because
register variables are reflected by all the language features together.
Therefore, a more elaborative investigation should be conducted to account for
those data in the future.

## Appendix

### Appendix 1: Business news report

Manufacturers *[subject]* are *[finite]* pessimistic *[complement]* for the
first time *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in two years *[adjunct: circumstantial]*
following a slump *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in expectations of [consumer
spending](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/consumerspending) and business
investment *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in the UK and abroad *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*.

A survey by the CBI *[subject] [finite: +past]* found *[predicate]* that

>   a growing number of companies in the industrial sector *[subject]* are
>   *[finite]* gloomy *[complement]* about the next year *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*

>   and *[finite: + present]* plan *[predicate]* to restrict investment
>   *[complement]*

>   and *[finite: + present]* cut *[predicate]* jobs *[complement]*.

The CBI *[subject] [finite: +past]* said *[predicate]* that

>   not since the depths of the recession in 2009 *[adjunct: circumstantial]*
>   had *[finite]* manufacturers *[subject]* adopted *[predicate]* such a
>   downbeat outlook *[complement]*, with expectations of slower activity
>   "driving a reappraisal of forward-looking business plans" *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*.

The Industrial Trends quarterly survey *[subject] [finite: +past]* found
*[predicate]* that

>   growth in total orders and production *[subject] [finite: +past]* eased
>   *[predicate]* slightly *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in the three months to
>   July *[adjunct: circumstantial]*, with a further deceleration expected over
>   the next quarter *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

"As a result *[adjunct: comment]*, after a fourth successive increase *[adjunct:
circumstantial]* in employment *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in this survey
*[adjunct: circumstantial]*, they *[subject] [finite: + present]* plan
*[predicate]* to cut headcount *[complement]* over the next three months
*[adjunct: circumstantial]*

and have *[finite]* revised *[predicate]* down their investment plans *[adjunct:
circumstantial]* for the year ahead *[adjunct: circumstantial]*," the business
trade body *[subject] [finite: +past]* said *[predicate]*.

Manufacturers *[subject] [finite: + present]* reported *[predicate]*

>   they *[subject]* were *[finite]* less optimistic *[complement]* than three
>   months ago *[adjunct: circumstantial]* after a fall *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]* from +9% to -16% *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in the CBI
>   index *[adjunct: circumstantial]*, the first fall in sentiment since July
>   2009 *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

The survey *[subject]* is *[finite]* an important indicator *[complement]* of
sentiment *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

and in the past *[adjunct: circumstantial]* has *[finite]* supported
*[predicate]* the Treasury's view *[complement]*

>   that the private sector *[subject]* can *[finite]* grow *[predicate]*
>   despite tax rises and cuts *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in public spending
>   *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

In April *[adjunct: circumstantial]* last year *[adjunct: circumstantial]*
manufacturers *[subject]* were *[finite]* at their most confident *[complement]*

and *[finite: +past]* indicated *[predicate]*

>   they *[subject]* would *[finite]* be seeking *[predicate]* to employ many
>   more people *[complement]*.

A slump in confidence in the latest survey *[subject]* will *[finite]* be seized
upon *[predicate]* by government critics *[adjunct: circumstantial]*,

>   who *[subject] [finite: + present]* believe *[predicate]*

>   it *[subject]* was *[finite]* always optimistic *[complement]* to expect the
>   industrial sector to pick up the slack in the rest of the economy and almost
>   single-handedly reduce unemployment *[subject]*.

The CBI survey *[subject] [finite: + present]* fits *[predicate]* with reports
*[complement]* from other sectors *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   that *[subject]* have *[finite]* reported *[predicate]* a slump
>   *[complement]* in confidence *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

Analysts *[subject]* are *[finite]* predicting *[predicate]*

>   that the Treasury *[subject]* will *[finite]* be forced *[predicate]* to cut
>   its growth estimate *[complement]* for the UK *[adjunct: circumstantial]*
>   after

>   gross domestic production data *[subject]* on Tuesday *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial] [finite: +past]* showed *[predicate]* that

>   activity *[subject] [finite: +past]* increased *[predicate]* by just 0.2%
>   *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in the second quarter of 2011 *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*, after flatlining in the previous six months *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*.

### Appendix 2: A business letter sent from the HSBC bank to its customer about the service changes in his/her bank card.

Your HSBC Debit Card *[subject]* is *[finite]* changing *[predicate].*

We *[subject]* ’re *[finite]* always *[adjunct: mood]* looking for *[predicate]*
ways *[complement]* to improve your banking service *[adjunct: circumstantial]*,

so we *[subject]* ’re *[finite]* pleased *[predicate]* to tell you
*[complement]* about some changes *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   we *[subject]* ’ve *[finite]* made *[predicate]* to your HSBC Debit Card
>   *[complement]*,

>   which you *[subject]* ’ll *[finite]* receive *[predicate]* within the next
>   few weeks *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

What *[WH-/Subject]* ’s *[finite]* new *[complement]*?

Your debit card *[subject]* is *[finite]* changing *[predicate]* from an HSBC
Maestro Debit Card *[adjunct: circumstantial]* to an HSBC Visa Debit Card
*[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

>   Although you *[subject]* may *[finite]* associate *[predicate]* Visa
>   *[complement]* with credit cards *[adjunct: circumstantial]*,

it *[subject]* ’s *[finite]* actually *[adjunct: mood]* used *[predicate]* on
millions of debit cards *[adjunct: circumstantial]* around the world *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*.

This *[subject] [finite: + present]* means *[predicate]*

>   that your card *[subject]* will *[finite]* soon *[adjunct: mood]* be
>   accepted *[predicate]* in more places than ever before *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*.

The new card *[subject]* is *[finite]* not only more widely accepted
*[predicate]*,

it *[subject]* ’s *[finite]* also designed *[predicate]* with online safety in
mind *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

Verified by Visa *[subject]* is *[finite]* a free service *[complement]*

>   that *[finite: + present]* allows *[predicate]* you *[complement]* to add
>   password protection *[adjunct: circumstantial]* to your card *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*

>   when you *[subject] [finite: + present]* shop *[predicate]* on the web
>   *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

So *[adjunct: textual]*

>   if your card *[subject]* is *[finite]* lost or stolen *[predicate]*,

there *[subject]* ’s *[finite]* less chance *[complement]*

>   that you *[subject]* ’ll *[finite]* be inconvenienced *[predicate]* by
>   fraudulent use *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

Some customers *[subject]* will *[finite]* also see *[predicate]* a reduction
*[complement]* in or removal *[adjunct: circumstantial]* of their cheque
guarantee limit *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

What *[WH-/Subject] [finite: + present]* stays *[predicate]* the same
*[complement]*?

>   Although we *[subject]* ’ve *[finite]* made *[predicate]* changes
>   *[complement]* to your debit card *[adjunct: circumstantial]*,

you *[subject]* won’t *[finite]* lose *[predicate]* the other features
*[complement]*

>   you *[subject] [finite: + present]* have *[predicate]* now *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*.

The change to Visa Debit *[subject]* won’t *[finite]* affect *[predicate]* your
account *[complement]*,

you *[subject]* can *[finite]* use *[predicate]* your new card *[complement]* in
exactly the same way *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   you *[subject] [finite: + present]* use *[predicate]* your current one
>   *[complement]*

>   and your PIN *[subject] [finite: + present]* stays *[predicate]* the same
>   *[complement]* (unless advised otherwise).

What *[WH-/Complement]* do *[finite]* you *[subject]* need *[predicate]* to do
*[complement]*?

>   When your new card *[subject] [finite: + present]* arrives *[predicate]*,

it *[subject]* will *[finite]* need *[predicate]* to be activated *[complement]*

>   before you *[subject]* can *[finite]* use*[predicate]* it *[complement]*.

It *[subject]* can *[finite]* be activated *[predicate]* at any cash
machine*[adjunct: circumstantial]*, online or over the phone *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*,

>   Which *[subject]* will *[finite]* only take *[predicate]* a few moments
>   *[complement]*.

Your existing card *[subject]* will *[finite]* be *[predicate]* valid
*[complement]* for 45 days *[adjunct: circumstantial]* from receipt *[adjunct:
circumstantial]* of your new card *[adjunct: circumstantial]*, or until the
expiry date *[adjunct: circumstantial]* shown on your existing card *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*

>   \-whichever *[subject] [finite: + present]* comes *[predicate]* first
>   *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

>   If you *[subject] [finite: + present]* have *[predicate]* any concerns or
>   questions *[complement]* about the upcoming changes *[adjunct:
>   circumstantial]*,

### Appendix 3: Extract of feature article on business:

ONE OF THE privileges *[subject]*

>   that urban hukou holders *[subject] [finite: + present]* enjoy *[predicate]*

is *[finite]* access to jobs *[complement]* in the state sector *[adjunct:
circumstantial]* in the cities *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   where they *[subject]* were *[finite]* born *[predicate]*.

In the late 1990s *[adjunct: circumstantial]* such work *[subject]* might
*[finite]* have sounded  *[predicate]* precarious *[complement]*

>   as China *[subject] [finite: + past]* closed down or sold off *[predicate]*
>   thousands of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) *[complement]*, throwing
>   millions out of work *[complement]*.

But *[adjunct: textual]* those SOEs that remain *[subject]* are *[finite]*
giants *[complement]*: 121 *[subject] [finite: + past]* controlled *[predicate]*
directly by the central government *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

and thousands of others *[subject] [finite: + present]* run *[predicate]* by
lower-level authorities *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

Chinese students *[subject] [finite: + past]* used to *[predicate]* aspire to a
job *[complement]* with a foreign company *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

Now *[adjunct: circumstantial]* they *[subject]* are *[finite]* more likely
*[predicate]* to want one with an SOE *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

This *[subject]* may *[finite]* seem *[predicate]* an odd choice *[complement]*,

>   since the dynamism in China’s economy *[subject]* is *[finite]* mostly
>   generated *[predicate]* by non-state firms *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

From 1999 to 2009 *[adjunct: circumstantial]* the state’s share of industrial
output by value *[subject] [finite]* fell *[predicate]* from 49% to 27%
*[adjunct: circumstantial]*, according to a recent report by Unirule Institute
of Economics *[adjunct: circumstantial]*, an independent think-tank in Beijing
*[adjunct: circumstantial]*.

In 1999 *[adjunct: circumstantial]* government-controlled firms *[subject]
[finite]* owned *[predicate]* 67% of industrial capital *[complement]*;

a decade later *[adjunct: circumstantial]* their share *[subject]* had
*[finite]* fallen *[predicate]* to 41% *[complement]*.

But in the industries *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   that *[subject] [finite]* pay *[predicate]* the highest salaries
>   *[complement]*,

state firms *[subject] [finite]* dominate *[predicate]*.

Of 42 mainland Chinese companies *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in the Fortune 500
list *[adjunct: circumstantial]* of the world’s biggest firms *[adjunct:
circumstantial]* in 2010 *[adjunct: circumstantial]*, all but three *[subject]*
were *[finite]* owned *[predicate]* by the government *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*.

Carl Walter *[subject]*, a Beijing-based investment banker *[subject]*,
*[finite]* said *[predicate]* in a recent book *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   that getting as many companies as possible into that select group
>   *[subject]* was *[finite]* a matter of deliberate policy *[complement]*.

China’s own list of the 500 biggest Chinese companies*[subject] [finite]* spans
*[predicate]* 75 industries *[complement]*.

In 29 of these *[adjunct: circumstantial]* not a single private firm *[subject]
[finite]* makes *[predicate]* the grade and in ten others *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*

they *[subject] [finite]* play *[predicate]* only a minor part *[complement]*.

The government-owned enterprises in these 39 state-dominated sectors *[subject]
[finite]* control *[predicate]* 85% of the total assets *[complement]* of all
the 500 companies *[adjunct: circumstantial]* in the list *[adjunct:
circumstantial]*, according to researchers *[adjunct: circumstantial]* from the
China Enterprise Confederation *[adjunct: circumstantial]*

>   which *[subject] [finite]* compiled *[predicate]* it *[complement]*.

In 2010 *[adjunct: circumstantial]*, 75 of the confederation’s list of the 100
biggest publicly traded Chinese firms *[subject]* were *[finite]* controlled
*[predicate]* by the government *[adjunct: circumstantial]*.
