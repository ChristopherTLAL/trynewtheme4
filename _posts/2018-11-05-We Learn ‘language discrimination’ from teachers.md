## Introduction

Modern technological development, whereby language learners can study English in
more casual circumstances, enhance the speed of language acquisition.
Nevertheless, the major mean for ESL (English as a second language) education is
still classroom teaching, leading English teacher training to become a prevalent
topic (Horwitz, 2008).

For a long time, English standardisation has predominated the expanding circle
countries which guides their ESL teachers to emphasise the British and American
English pedagogical models (Adamson, 2004; Bolton, 2006; Lam, 2002). However,
the international ESL community has experienced a revolution raised by World
Englishes (WE) and English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) researchers like Kachru
(1985, 1988, 1992a, 1992b, 2005), Jenkins (1998, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007),
Kirkpatrick (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008), and Seidlhofer (1999, 2004, 2006).
These theories popularised cultivating students to accept every English with L1
accent which is natural and neutral in an era of English as a global language.
In this regard, the debates are raging over whether there is a standard English
acknowledged universally and what educational pattern is appropriate in
non-inner-circle countries, as they will substantially shape students' attitudes
towards various English varieties (Timmis, 2002, 2005).

As a country containing the largest ESL learner community (Wei & Feng, 2015) and
legitimating an official language which considerably influences people's
English-speaking cross-linguistically (Li, 2007; Qiong, 2004; Yajun, 2003),
China is a typical object where researchers investigate the level of
"antidiscrimination" among distinct English varieties. Even recently, there
exist enormous declarations exhibiting Chinese people’s disrespect and even
despair on China English (Nuske, 2018). Accordingly, it is worthwhile examining
English teachers’ familiarity of the critical paradigms on English
(specifically, WE and ELF) and their favoured English pedagogical model, which
can facilitate their students to understand that China English is not a
stigmatised variation.

Although undergraduates majoring in English will be undeniably cultivated with
sociolinguistic critical paradigms including the WE and ELF ones, master
students majoring in TESOL (Teaching English to the Speakers of Other Languages)
or English Education, the majority of whom are more probable to become English
teachers, concentrate more on teaching method training with a lack of linguistic
knowledge. Based on it, the prospective English teachers may spread their own
“immature” attitudes towards China English through their instilment and teaching
strategies in the foreseeable future.

In these respects, aiming at ascertaining if Chinese next generation will pick
up "language discrimination" from their teachers, this fieldwork will be
conducted primarily on three research questions:

>   *RQ1. Whether there is a knowledge insufficiency of WE or ELF paradigms of
>   TESOL students?*

>   *RQ2. Whether TESOL students have relatively negative perspectives to China
>   English?*

>   *RQ3. Would TESOL students prefer and choose a variety of standard English
>   (British or American one) as their education model and instil this certain
>   model to their students in English language teaching?*

## Method

### Instrument

For ascertaining RQ1, questionnaire survey 1 was conducted to quantify TESOL
students' and English major students' comprehension on the WE and ELF paradigm.
In this section, the questionnaire was translated into Chinese to ensure an
ample understanding of the items. To validate it, we utilised back-translation
which is frequently applied to confirm the resemblance of the two dissimilar
languages forms of the questionnaire (Sousa & Rojjanasrirat, 2011). After
conducting a reliability analysis on the pilot study, two questions were deleted
due to their low *Cronbach α* value which means that they are not credible
(Loewen & Plonsky, 2015).

In terms of RQ2, questionnaire survey 2 and matched-guise technique (MGT) was
utilised to evaluate the sample's perspective of three varieties of English
including British English, American English, and China English. In this section,
the reliability is augmented after triangulating the survey data with those
collected from the interview and the MGT outcomes. For this part, although QS2
is appropriated from He and Zhang (2010) denoting that it has already been
validated, the MGT's credibility may be relatively low due to author's lack of
expertise in this instrument. Therefore, a more comprehensive and reliable
methodology is required in future studies.

Additionally, the interview is considered to be the most feasible method to
analyse the sample's preference of the pedagogical model. Some interview
questions may be identical to the former survey ones, which can be used to
verify the results tested via different instruments.

### Participant

Total 50 participants (undergraduate n=34, postgraduate n=16) finished the
questionnaire survey which estimates their knowledge of WE or ELF. All the
participants are from BA programmes from Department of English and MA TESOL in
Xi'an Jiao-tong Liverpool University. 58% of them (undergraduate n=20,
postgraduate n=9) filled the 2-item questionnaire and the MGT one investigating
their attitudes towards Standard English and China English. Furthermore, six
TESOL students participated in the interview.

## Finding

### Questionnaire Survey 1

Table 1 presents that undergraduates do have a comparatively low inclination to
be an English teacher in their future (p\<0.0005, r=0.67), which verifies this
study's precondition.

Note: QS1Q2.3.4: Questionnaire Survey 1 Question 2, 3, 4

Based on Table 2, English-major undergraduates overtly have a deeper
comprehension of World Englishes (p\<0.05, r=0.33). In this respect, TESOL
students show a surprisingly low rating on the understanding of WE with a mean
of 3.13, a median of 3, and also a maximum rating of 4, which are all lower than
that of the undergraduate students. However, this disparity does not emerge in
terms of the examination of ELF (p\>0.05, r=0.02).

### Questionnaire Survey 2

With reference to Table 3, 54% (N=27) of the participants (or their students)
prefer to be like "can pronounce English clearly … but … have the accent of my
country", whereas 46% (N=23) would claim that they incline more to a native-like
proficiency. It suggests that over half of the sample are open to the English
speaking with a certain first language accent, so long as they can establish
comprehensible communication with others. After scrutinising the explanations
for their answer, it is realised that the majority of those who argue for that
consider English just as a tool for communication, showing that the interaction
between different people does not necessitate a native-like pronunciation. For
these participants, additionally, 33% of them ascribe it to identity protection,
signifying that they intend to be categorised as Chinese while articulating
foreign language. The third principal reason is that 15% of the participants who
select student B suppose that English learners are constantly subject to the
cross-linguistic influence hampering them to speak English natively.

For this question, displayed by Table 3, through organising independent sample
t-test, it is noticed that there is little differentiation between English-major
undergraduates and TESOL-major master students (p\>0.05).

Table 4 manifests that 44% of the sample desire they or their students'
competence on grammar can be like student E, who even mastering the informal
grammar applied by native speakers. Among them, 55.2% claimed that a high-level
capability on all kinds of grammar can facilitate communication, especially via
reducing the misinterpreting and ambiguous discourse.

### MGT

As the Match-guises Technique outcomes are not statistically significant on the
American English and British English, these two cohorts are merged to be one
test variable entitled Standard English.

Generally, the findings in this segment are consistent with that of the
survey-based research QS2 reported previously. Table 6 proves that 12 out of 16
personality traits implied by China English and Standard English being ranked by
the participants are statistically significant. In this regard, Standard English
is recognised as a positive variety as its ratings on all the positive
characteristics are higher than China English's. Upon two negative
*personalities aggressive* as well as *arrogant*, China English were marked
surprisingly high than the other, both indicating that Standard English is
favoured by the participants. However, even these persons incline more on
Standard English, the means upon all the positive personalities are close to the
median 3. This result is compatible with the survey L2Q1 on pronunciation which
displays that the participants do not despise non-native-like accent.

### Interview

The qualitative data collected in this section is generally consistent with the
quantitative one. A pretty high percent (92%) of our participants reported that
they feel unsatisfied with the language capacity of them or their students.
Nevertheless, most of them did not attribute this situation to the inefficiency
of the standard English based pedagogical model. Hence, together with the other
Interview Question asking them for their adoption of teaching model, it can be
inferred that over 80% of the TESOL students will adhere to employing Standard
English as their teaching framework. However, it should not be neglected that
26% of them still demonstrated that their students’ aims are not to attain a
standard English level but an effective communication level.

Of the questions to exploring the reasons for standard English inclination, some
TESOL students claimed that:

>   We have to take something as a standard, and we always use it (standard
>   English) to teach. Well, I think I quite like native speakers’
>   pronunciation, especially when I watch some videos.

When enquiring them whether we should adopt a certain standard English
educational model in China, they claimed that:

>   Of course, because China English or Chinese English are immature variety, so
>   we cannot give profound instructions to our students.

>   No, it’s not necessary to be native-like. You can communicate, then you are
>   good enough.

On the question about which model will they use in their future teaching, they
answered:

>   For me, I think maybe standard English. Unlike Australia or Singapore, China
>   is a country with only Chinese one official language, so it is so hard for
>   us to define and even teach its own English variety.

>   Standard English, I think perhaps China English will be a bad sample for
>   students and will influence communication.

>   I wish China English because it is extensively simpler for my students
>   although I have to ensure this variety is well-constructed.

## Discussion

### Research Question 1

Referring to the data, TESOL students do lack the knowledge of WE, whereas this
disparity does not exist in ELF. The reason for this interesting phenomenon may
be that the education of English's status quo entails the introduction of ELF,
which perhaps does not comprise its contribution on diminishing "language
discrimination" but only its function as a bridge between people without a
shared language. Therefore, WE can possibly help more on it because of its overt
support on English diversity.

### Research Question 2

It is surprising to observe that the majority of the participants embrace the
English with a Chinese accent, and the high command on grammar acquisition is
solely form the needs of effective communication. Nevertheless, among these
individuals who claimed to be open to various English varieties, numerous ones
attach their stance to the desires for performing Chinese identity and the
impossibility of reaching a native-like proficiency. Referring to the former
reason, it is considered not to be a neutral attitude towards diverse English
varieties but a reverse discrimination preferring China English. Upon the latter
one, it seems that the China English acquisition happens when there is no
alternative, which reveals the superiority of Standard English.

Similarly, the result of the MGT also attests that the participants prefer
Standard English rather than China English. Nonetheless, it may be invalid as
MGT will compel the sample to rate dissimilarly, which might exaggerate the
attitudinal divergence between these languages. Additionally, the MGT shows
little significance on 3 out of 14 positive personality traits, and all the
positive items about China English are rated close to the median 3 as mentioned
in the finding section, indicating China English is not perceived that negative
by these individuals.

### Research Question 3

Although most TESOL students announced that they will employ Standard English as
their pedagogical model, the reason for that is not the preference to a native
norm but China English is not a well-established variation. In this respect,
most participants dislike using China English as the teaching model, because it
will generate a harmful effect on students' communication despite the fact that
it will accelerate students' learning. Furthermore, two TESOL students harbour
pessimistic view on the advancement of China English, believing it cannot be
adequately and fully defined in a society with only one official language.

### Conclusion

This fieldwork has assessed the sample's understanding of WE and ELF, their
attitudes towards distinct English varieties, and their possible adoption on the
pedagogical model. Fortunately, being familiar with these two paradigms, more
TESOL students are open to diverse English varieties. However, as China English
is ill-defined, they will adhere to the Standard English model in the
foreseeable future just like their counterparts who hold negative attitudes
towards China English, hindering the antidiscrimination of English varieties.
Consequently, the construct and complement of China English are urgently
required.

Moreover, the results of this fieldwork are limited by the restricted sample
size, the imperfectly-validated instrument, and also the author's inadequate
knowledge, which may leave the interpretation superficial and untenable. On
that, more researchers are expected to concern this condition, contributing to
the language antidiscrimination of both China and the whole world.

We live life in the network. When we wake up in the morning, we check our
e-mail, make a quick phone call, walk outside, get on the bus or drive. We
arrive at the airport, making sure to purchase a sandwich with a credit card
before boarding the plane, and check our Blackberries shortly before take-off.
Or we visit the doctor or the car mechanic, generating digital records of what
our medical or automotive problems are. We post blog entries confiding to the
world our thoughts and feelings, or maintain personal social network profiles
revealing our friendships and our tastes. Each of these transactions leaves
digital breadcrumbs which, when pulled together, offer increasingly
comprehensive pictures of both individuals and groups, with the potential of
transforming our understanding of our lives, organizations, and societies in a
fashion that was barely conceivable just a few years ago.
