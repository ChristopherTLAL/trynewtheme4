# 1. Introduction

The article under examination is *Where does the sociolinguistic variable stop?*
(henceforth the selected paper) written by Lavandera (1978). This selected paper
majorly centres on evaluating the validity and feasibility of studying
sociolinguistic variation from phonological and non-phonological perspective.
Based on ample evidence and demonstration, the author claimed that the
contemporary exploration on syntactic, semantic, and morphological
sociolinguistic variations are all less valid ones. The reason for this
argumentation is that the majority of these non-phonological assessments cannot
certify the sameness in referential meaning between the language pair under
investigation. For example, the term *wipe out* harbours the stylistic
significance as an informal usage compared to its counterpart *exhausted*;
nevertheless, it is not because the dissimilarity of style alone is significant
but these “forms themselves carry differences in meaning” (Lavandera, 1978, p.
21). Contrarily, in terms of phonological comparison, the researchers incline
more on selecting the different accents of one word, which ensures the
identicalness of the referential meaning. Therefore, Lavandera reflected
critically on whether the researchers can go beyond the phonological evaluation
of sociolinguistic variation analysis. In this regard, this essay will argue
against restricting the sociolinguistic variation analysis into phonological
scrutiny, primarily via the redefinition of sociolinguistic variation.

# 2. Redefinition of Sociolinguistic Variation

## 2.1 The Definition of Sociolinguistic Variation in the Selected Paper

The principal criticism about the selected paper is the definition of
sociolinguistic variation, majorly represented by the sampling strategy. To
understand that definition in the selected paper, two contradictory
methodologies of collecting data should be comprehended. Phonologically, the
different pronunciation of one term in different speech communities was
examined, exemplified by *Laughing* and *Laughin’* (Lavandera, 1978, p. 21).
Non-phonologically, the sampling method actually is to gather data from the same
speech community. As mentioned in the introduction section, synonyms or other
synonymous language forms, like *wipe out* and *exhausted*, were chose and the
social functions fulfilled when speakers utilise them were assessed. The
selected article considered it sometimes invalid, because these language pairs
may be the intrinsic carriers of social function, which signifies that their
social or stylistic significance is embodied in their referential meaning.

Based on this consideration, the paper emphasised the importance of
distinguishing the social or stylistic significance derived from the words’
compatibility of contexts per se and that from non-referential information.
After reviewing considerable studies, the paper indicated that numerous
researchers incorrectly conducted their investigation due to the ignorance of
this disparity. Among all the papers reviewed by Lavandera (1978), the author
only reflected positively on Sankoff and Thibault (1977)'s study which manually
set aside considerable contexts in which both French synonymous auxiliaries
*être* and *avoir* appear but denote differently. This effort was thought to be
worthwhile and the result, presenting that there is only one context in which
these two items’ referential meanings are identical but non-referential meanings
were introduced according to social constraints, was regarded to be credible.

Moreover, in the selected paper’s paradigm, the identification of the
non-phonological sociolinguistic variation is chiefly from the frequency of
utilisation in diverse situations. In this regard, scholars chose two terms in
the same speech community and evaluated their sameness or lexical synonymy
before they statistically calculate the frequency of them in several contexts.
If they “establish a clear social stratification of the option” (Weiner & Labov,
1983), they can serve two linguistic items as sociolinguistic variables, and
*vice versa*. Therefore, I may summarise this definition as follows:
sociolinguistic variation is the referentially similar linguistic pairs (no
matter it is from different speech communities or not) which can be
statistically proved to establish a social stratification.

## 2.2 The Redefinition of Sociolinguistic Variation in the Present Paper

To understand the importance of the redefinition, it has to be recognised the
aim of the sociolinguistic variation. In a long period, the whole academia
concentrates on the linguistic analysis, especially referential-meaning-based
one, predominating the investigation on the other meanings (Lavandera, 1978).
Hymes (1974) promoted the social or stylistic significance to an equivalent
stage with the previous one after reviewing and summarising Labov's theory.
After that, the main goal of sociolinguistic variation study became the analysis
of social or stylistic significance. Therefore, it can be concluded that our
target, as well as the target in the selected paper, is not the review on
lexical meaning but social significance.

To achieve this goal, the social factor has to be involved in the sampling
process. Taking *wipe out* and *exhausted* as an example, the principal weakness
of this selection is the ignorance of social variables. From my perspective,
this scheme of analysing different terms is only the estimate of lexical
synonymy but not sociolinguistic variation. In this case, the two linguistic
items are both from the same speech community and their frequency
differentiation in distinct contexts may be solely from their inherent meaning
disparity. In the paradigm the present essay proposed, the selection of
sociolinguistic variation must be in different speech communities or social
groups. As long as it fulfils this condition, this certain language pair can be
identified as sociolinguistic variation. Differently, in the selected paper’s
system, if these two words cannot “establish a clear social stratification of
the option” (Weiner & Labov, 1983) after calculating their usage, it may not be
a sociolinguistic variable. Simply speaking, the social stratification is the
starting point of our definition, but the result of Lavandera’s system.

The phonological approach in Lavandera’s paper, picking up the same word
pronounced differently in the dissimilar speech community, perfectly matches
this paradigm. Contrarily, the main unreliability revealed by the
non-phonological approach is that it fails to include social variables
(different speech communities in this case) in constructing sociolinguistic
variations, which directs the researcher to incline more on analysing
phonological variation. In this respect, the selected paper only focuses on the
fact that the non-phonological approach ignores or fails to confirm the sameness
of the language pair, but does not speculate on the reliability of the sampling
method. I do respect the selected paper’s criticism on the invalidity of these
non-phonological analyses of variation, nevertheless, the cause of it is not on
the words' referentially embodied social significance but the intrinsic sampling
incorrectness. Based on an inequitable definition and sampling strategy, this
inclination of suppressing non-phonological analysis advances rapidly.

In my system, it may be criticised that all the codes in different speech
communities can be called sociolinguistic variables, which seems to diminish the
usefulness and purpose of proposing a new definition. However, the identical
non-referential meaning is not a shameful result because it may indeed represent
a certain social issue. Furthermore, invoking a concept in Second Language
Acquisition, the meanings of two sociolinguistic variations may not differ from
each other because it may be a *positive transfer*. In SLA, it means that the
second language learners' L1 can help them study a foreign language if these two
languages share some common feature, whereby speakers positively transfer their
L1's feature to their L2 utilisation. In our system, it means that the speakers'
understanding of the language pair does not fluctuate as the variation keeps the
same features of one word, both referential and non-referential. Consequently,
my redefinition of sociolinguistic variation is simply as follows:
sociolinguistic variation is the linguistic pairs from different speech
communities.

## 2.3 The Precondition of the Definition

Both in the selected paper's and my paradigm, the preliminary test of ensuring
the referential identicalness is important, as control variate method is
reliable for scientific examination. In the selected paper, the phonological one
represents a relatively tenable argumentation and a reliable sampling method of
variation analysis. The major reason for its validity is the inherent sameness
of referential meaning. Similarly, announced by Lavandera, the non-phonological
examples can be recognised as reliable when the researchers can ascertain the
referential identicalness of the language pair. However, apart from the
heuristic categorising process (*cf*. *être* and *avoir* in Section 2.2), it
seems that the selected paper was led astray by the previous researchers,
because this ensuring of sameness actually goes back to the confirmation of
lexical synonymy.

The phonological approach in the selected paper which used the same word
articulate differently is a pretty valid one in this case. The similar approach
should be used in non-phonological variables when we assess sociolinguistic
variation, especially when we desire to compare these two sampling methods. The
next section will give two possible alternatives to the incorrect sampling
method of the selected paper.

# 3. Potential Non-Phonological Sampling Method

## 3.1 Cross-Cultural Comparison of the Same Word

The first possible valid one is to compare the non-phonological variations in a
cross-cultural context. It has to be noticed that the concept of “culture” is a
relatively broad one, which may comprise the state-based culture (Chinese
context, British context, Australian context, and so on), the ethnicity-based
culture (the Jewish culture, the Roma culture, the Han culture, and so on), the
discipline-based culture (the Business culture, the Environmental culture, the
Feminism culture, and so on), and the others. Additionally, it may even go
beyond the social-constructed parameters such as social stratification,
generational differences generated by age, and social contexts, to the
parameters of certain non-social-constructed ones (e.g. sex). As redefined in
Section 2, the sociolinguistic variation can be acknowledged as long as the
parameters can divide speech communities.

However, the tricky part in this section is that the cross-cultural comparison
also has to be an intrapersonal one because an individual can have the right to
choose only when they know how to speak in both two speech communities. If the
researchers investigate the social and stylistic difference of a word from a
general cultural comparison standpoint, it will return to the puzzle of only
assessing the synonymy or cross-cultural identicalness. In the selected paper,
the valid comparison from a phonological aspect was conducted on the
participants who acquired two different accents, which is expected in a
non-phonological aspect as well. In this respect, perhaps the most efficient and
practical way of collecting data is to find individuals in one community but
from the other; For example, British citizens living in the United State for a
long time, Indian bride who moved to their husbands’ tribe, or male feminist.

To elaborate on this sampling strategy, this following paragraph will provide an
instance of the investigation on male feminist. In the previous study, it is
found that females will avoid using dirty word due to the “clean” and
“beautiful” archetype for women, “misleading” the males to frequently utilise
them as a symbol for superiority (Lakoff, 1973). It may be argued that
transgressive discourse will be applied differently by male feminist, compared
to their male counterparts. The deeper reason for that might be the sample’s
acceptance of feminism theory, their awareness of gender equality, or even their
reverse discrimination against patriarchal ideology. Due to the possible
self-attribution bias, this idea may be left to the prospective research,
ascertaining whether there really is the social significance of the profanity
utilisation between these two speech communities

## 3.2 Utilisation of the Same Word by Multilingual People

The second possible solution is to evaluate multilingual persons’ utilisation of
different languages. In this section, it is not to simply compare the meaning of
different codes, which seemingly is the realm of translation study. The
investigation on certain language pair among languages is valuable; For example,
Diessel and Hetterle (2011)'s study on causal clauses among 60 languages.
However, it is still not the case of our variation study, which is to explore
the social function of one variation selected by the speakers. To align with our
paradigm, the study majorly needs to be about Second Language Acquisition,
specifically, of the individuals who acquire more than one L1. The primary issue
here becomes how can we ensure the sameness of language pair in two distinct
linguistic systems.

To ensure the sameness of meaning, the supportive evidence will be provided both
from neural science and psycholinguistic perspective. It was proved by various
studies that certain linguistic processes and forms are shared
cross-linguistically, and in most cases two L1s are activated in parallel (Chee,
2006; Chee, Soon, & Lee, 2003; Grainger, Jacobs, & Jacobs, 2013; Hartsuiker,
Pickering, & Veltkamp, 2004; Klein *et al*., 1994; Kroll, Bobb, & Wodniecka,
2006). Cognitively, when bilinguals or multilinguals are employing any one of
their languages, the similar if not the same brain zones are involved (Perani
*et al*., 1998). Additionally, the two or more L1s actually share the same
linguistic principle which governs the construction of them (Kotz, 2009; Willms
et al., 2011). Even some cognitive analyses do find that some languages trigger
different brain areas, it was proven that it majorly influences the effort of
processing the second language rather than the representation of the L1s
(Abutalebi, 2008; Golestani et al., 2006; Luk *et al*., 2012). Therefore, the
neural circuitry housing L1s of multilinguals is nearly the same, leading the
language construct and language computation process in a quite similar way.

Nevertheless, this method is a less valid one than the sampling strategy
proposed in Section 3.1. Firstly, the psycholinguistic philosophy is not
well-constructed which hinders our understanding of multilingual people. For
example, through speculating structural constraints, Müller and Cantone (2009)
proposed that child code-mixing which are seen as bilingual L1 can be the same
as adult ones. Secondly, the types of bilingual or multilingual people vary
according to their living conditions; for instance, there is difference between
simultaneous bilinguals whose two L1s are acquired from birth and successive
bilinguals whose two L1s acquired in different stage, but both before critical
period (Green *et al*., 2003). This drawback may be addressed by manually
identify the cases, but from the researchers’ instinct or experience sabotaging
*a priori* principle. Probably, the different level of multilingualism shows
some hint of the different social status and economic situations. It might be
solved by the accurate evaluation of their multilingual level (e.g. via Global
Measures of Multilingualism in Dewaele and Wei (2013)) and living conditions.
Additionally, individuals acquiring two L1s may present different proficiency on
them, possibly with equal expertise or one overtly dominant proficiency. Due to
the substantial interaction between two L1s, the participants may incorrectly
measure their language ability invalidating the frequently used self-rated
language proficiency score, which entails a well-established language test to
rate their proficiency. Consequently, adopting this method, it should be pretty
cautious about all the possible low structural validity.

To be careful, the possible starting point of this method may be the terms which
have been proved to be the same. This means that the researchers can analyse the
universal conceptual metaphor or natural semantic metalanguage as our first
step. For instance, the case study of ANGER IS HEAT conducted by Lakoff and
Kövecses (1987) can be extended to the sociolinguistic variation analysis on
social or stylistic significance.

# 4. Conclusion

This essay proposed a new approach to collecting sociolinguistic variation data
and presented two possible alternatives for the selected papers' sample. On an
unequal definition, the selected paper claimed that the researchers should
"stop" at the phonological stage. However, correcting this definition, it was
emphasised that the sociolinguistic variation analysis should "start" at the
social level. It has to be noticed that, even this definition is a better one
than that in the selected paper, it requires careful sampling and accurate
preliminary test. Additionally, the system cannot be well-established in this
short essay. In this regard, the future investigation may have a clear
delimitation on the proposed paradigm, for example, the scope of speech
community in our system. Besides all these efforts on the definition, a further
and also deeper issue on the importance of these systems should be considered.
In this regard, possibly, whether the sociolinguistic variation analysis should
ensure the referential sameness is expected to discuss.
