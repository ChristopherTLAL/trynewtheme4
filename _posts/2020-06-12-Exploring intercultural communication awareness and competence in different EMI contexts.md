### Introduction

To analyse the model of intercultural communicative competence (ICC), the notion
of ‘culture’ has experienced three waves of evolution: (1) culture as a
geographical and national concept (Bowe et al., 2014); (2) culture as a
psycholinguistic construct (Bolden, 2012; Whorf, 1956); and (3) culture as a
critical and complex process against structuralism paradigm (Baker, 2011; Kaur,
2011). Although the third philosophy proposes a dynamic model, empirical
research to confirm this model is not enough.

The present essay will focus on Chinese EFL students who are attending or have
attended the English as Medium Instruction (EMI) education model. Three contexts
will be discussed, including the Native Context (the teachers are English-native
speakers), Non-Native Context (the teachers are foreign non-native English
speakers), and Chinese Context (the teachers are Chinese non-native English
speakers). This project, therefore, will explore what the perceived difference
is among these three contexts.

### The Study

*Research Questions*

RQ1: What is the difference between intercultural communication awareness in the
three selected contexts?

RQ2: What is the relationship between intercultural communication awareness and
willingness to communicate in each of the three selected contexts?

RQ3: What is the relationship between intercultural communicative competence and
willingness to communicate in each of the three selected contexts?

*Instrument*

To ensure the validity of the data collection process, the instruments used in
this study were all localised into Chinese. Echoing the suggestion to
back-translate the questionnaire (Dörnyei & Taguchi, 2009), the author invited
one translator with the Chinese Accreditation for Translation (Level 3) to help
finish the process. Also, all the Likert-Scales were modified to be seven-point
due to its increased variability (Dawes, 2002). After developing the
questionnaire, four EFL students were involved in a focus group discussion about
the face validity of the instrument. Finally, all the negative items were
highlighted in the online questionnaire to remind the participants, and some
examples of the three contexts were provided in the bracket for references (see
Appendix for more).

To measure Willingness to Communicate (WTC), the instrument used is from very
recent research (Dewaele & Dewaele, 2018) which identified a positive
correlation between foreign language students’ WTC and attitudes to teachers.
The 12-item Likert Scale used to examine the Intercultural Communicative
Competence (ICC) is adapted from a 22-item instrument from a study exploring the
relationship between ICC and foreign language learning motivation (Mirzaei &
Forouzandeh, 2013). After running the reliability analysis, it was found that
one item is negatively influencing the internal consistency of the whole
construct which should be deleted (Larson-Hall, 2016). Therefore, the 11 items
left will be combined for later analysis (Cronbach’s alpha = .737). Three
self-developed questions were designed to ask the participants to rate the level
of intercultural elements they perceived in each of the three contexts. Due to
the single factor structure of these self-developed instruments, the reliability
may be lower than the two scales mentioned above, which should be refined in
future research.

*Procedure and Participants*

The questionnaire was entered into an online survey platform ‘Wenjuanxing.com’.
The author has informed every respondent the right to terminate the survey
process at any point they want. Also, anonymity was ensured during the data
collection procedure. After spreading the link of this questionnaire in a
snowball sampling manner, between 6th and 7th June 2020, a total of 67 cases
were collected. With this small-scale dataset, four cases were identified to be
invalid ones because of the violation of the theoretically minimum completing
time.

In the end, there are 63 cases (26 males, 35 females, and 2 other genders)
imported into the data analysis software *IBM SPSS 22.0*. Over 90% of them (*N*
= 57) have experiences attending the class taught by the selected three kinds of
teachers. The missing data of the other 10% (*N =* 6) was handled with
*Bayesian* imputation (Buhi et al., 2008). Three participants were invited to
involve in a short interview (approximately 15 minutes, see the following
section for more).

*Data Analysis*

To answer RQ1, the descriptive data analysis method was used to compare the
perceived intercultural communication element in the three contexts. To answer
RQ2 and RQ3, the author employed linear regression to assess to what extent the
independent variable(s) can predict the dependent variable(s). After the data
analysis, three participants were involved in a short interview as their
intercultural communicative competences were in the low (3.9, lower 20% of the
sample), medium (5.4, 50%), and high level (6.3, 80%), respectively. Limited by
time, the interview data were coded by the automatic transcribing tool
*iflyrec.com* without cross-validation, which should be refined in future
research. The transcript was analysed using the *emotion analysis* function in
*Nvivo 11* and validated by the *automatic searching* function of corpus tool
*the Prime Machine*.

### Results and Discussion

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the intercultural awareness (ICA)
in each of the three contexts. The *Bootstrap* method was used to provide a
confidence interval, based on which the lower and upper bound of the average
score can be observed (Larson‐Hall & Plonsky, 2015). It could be identified that
the Non-native teacher setting was recognised as the most intercultural one,
whereas the Chinese teacher setting was the least.

samples

Together with the interview data, it seems that the participants rate the ICA
based on their perception of the distance between the teacher and them. All
three interviewees claimed that nationality and perceived language competence
are the bases when they judge the interculturality existing in the context. For
instance, the first two foreign nationality settings are regarded as ‘more
intercultural’, but the English native speakers are comparatively less
intercultural because the participants are ‘cultivated with a lot of English
culture’ or ‘much easier to be understood by native speakers’. Differently, the
Chinese teacher context is perceived to be comparatively ‘less intercultural’.

To answer RQ 2 which focuses on the relationship between ICA and WTC, Table 2
was generated to show the correlation among all the seven constructs covered by
the present study. The effect sizes[^1] of Native context (*Spearman’s r* =
.299) and Non-native context (*Spearman’s r* = .382) are around the ‘medium’
level strength (Cohen, 1988), while this index is much lower in the Chinese
teacher context (*Spearman’s r* = .193). This result is not expected, because it
is hypothesised that the intercultural level perceived in a context will
negatively predict students’ WTC, that is, students would be more willing to
speak in a class with lower intercultural level.

[^1]: As the present project only approached a small scale of participants (*N*
    = 63), the significance level (*p-value*), which associates with sample
    size, is invalid to provide enough information (Wei et al., 2019).
    Therefore, effect sizes indexes were employed to interpret the data. It
    should be noticed that future research should involve more respondents to
    obtain higher statistical power.

Additionally, from Table 3, it could be observed that the sample’s WTC
(descriptive data) in Chinese teacher context did not surpass the other two
contexts. To explore the reasons behind the two conditions discussed above, in
the interview data, student B with medium level ICC claimed that Chinese
teachers might demise those students who presented their ideas a lot. Student C
with higher-level ICC reflected that, when attending the ‘less intercultural’
context, he will avoid himself to be ‘outstanding’ and ‘assertive’ which is
undervalued by the other Chinese students. In these respects, it seems that the
perceived cultural value of both the interlocutor and the peers will
significantly influence the speakers’ WTC.

Table 3: Descriptive Statistics on Willingness to Communicate

|                |      |                |
|----------------|------|----------------|
|                | Mean | Std. Deviation |
| Native WTC     | 5.19 | .824           |
| Non-native WTC | 5.26 | .992           |
| Chinese WTC    | 5.04 | 1.123          |

Another interesting finding is that WTC is the highest in non-native context,
which is the most intercultural one. In the interview, student A and B
demonstrated that they are freer to speak in the non-native teachers’ class, due
to the mediation of the lingua franca. To compare, in the native context, they
are afraid of making mistakes which will be easily spotted by the teacher. The
results above all lead to a tricky but valuable conclusion, that the learners in
the EMI class inclined to communicate with more intercultural or ‘unfamiliar’
interlocutors, because they prioritised the purpose of not making mistakes.
Especially for Chinese learners[^2], they also avoid being perceived as
self-assertive, which was reported to be culturally degraded.

[^2]: It should be noticed that the notion of ‘Chinese learner’ *per se* is
    plausible. Therefore, in the future research, a more comprehensive design
    should discuss the concept of culture in a more dynamic and even
    deconstructivism approach.

To answer RQ 3 which is about the relationship between ICC and WTC, the result
presented in Table 4 is quite surprising as it contradicts almost all of the
previous research findings, which identified a general positive linear relation
between intercultural communicative competence and willingness to communicate
(Clément et al., 2003; Matveev, 2017; Morreale et al., 2001; Spitzberg & Cupach,
1984). However, in the present study, if the collected data is valid, it seems
that ICC does not statistically significantly predict Native WTC (Adjusted *R2*
= -.001, *p* = .334), but Non-native WTC (Adjusted *R2* = .112, *p* = .034) and
Chinese WTC (Adjusted *R2* = .183, *p* = .008). To confirm whether this
inconsistent result is valid requires more replications in the future. If it is
valid, the author assumes that the previous paradigm which recognises ICC as a
variable directly predicting WTC needs to be refined.

| ICC→NNWTC | .141      | .112                        | .285                      | .129       | .375 | .034 |

In a new model, this relationship between ICC and WTC may be strongly moderated
by situational factors. Invoking the concepts of ‘face’ from pragmatics (Brown &
Levinson, 1987; Goffman, 2005), it is hypothesised that students in the EMI
class have a dual focus on being ‘acknowledged’ (positive face, requiring
connectedness) and ‘not wrong’ (negative face, requiring separateness). In the
non-native class (the most intercultural) representing high separateness, ICC
positively correlates with WTC as it could ensure the success of communication.
In the Chinese class (the least intercultural) representing high connectedness,
this correlation reappears as high ICC could equip the students with higher
openness and risk-taking (Kraemer et al., 2001; Liu & Fang, 2017) to fight
against the pressure to be ‘correct’. However, in the native class, perhaps this
context simultaneously represents a lower level separateness and connectedness,
resulting in a low correlation between ICC and WTC.

### Conclusion

The present essay explored the Chinese EFL learners’ profile of intercultural
awareness, intercultural communicative competence, and willingness to
communicate, in three selected contexts in EMI education. The Chinese teacher
context was proved to be the least intercultural setting, whereas the non-native
was the most. Interestingly, the participants’ WTC is the lowest in the Chinese
environment partly because they perceived that a low-level self-assertiveness is
valued. Also, they reflected that a higher-level English proficiency of teachers
might negatively influence the students’ WTC, due to the high transparency in
mistake-making. Surprisingly, the ICC level positively predicts WTC in
non-native and Chinese contexts, but not the native one. The implications for it
were discussed with reference to *face theory*.

Limited by length, the essay did not develop a new model discussing the dynamic
interaction among the constructs covered in this project. In the future, more
studies should be conducted to confirm the current findings and further explore
the situational nature of the selected variables.
