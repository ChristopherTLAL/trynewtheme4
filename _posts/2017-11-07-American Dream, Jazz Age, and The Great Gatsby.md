The United States of America confronted a rapid expansion in the economy after
the Industrial Revolution happened in 1860. This material affluence and economic
growth have reached an unprecedented stage from the finish of World War I (1918)
to the Great Depression (1929) which is regarded as the Jazz Age (Maier et al.,
2006). The significant economic progress impels considerable Americans to pursue
the American Dreams which is described by (Kamp, 2009) as liberty,
individualism, and pursuit of happiness. Nevertheless, during this period, the
Matthew Effect escalates severely which signifies that the distribution of
incomes and wealth initiates to polarize in the United States (McMahon, 2004).
This phenomenon, reducing the possibilities of lower-class people moving in
fashionable circles, depresses the individuals who attempt vigorously to achieve
the success and realise the American Dream. In accordance with Boyer (2012), the
young generation rejected the conventional morals and values, pursued the
consumerism, and lived an extravagant and dissipated life in this period.
Meanwhile, the hopelessness and emptiness exist and extend because the new
values have not formulated which affect them only to reflect individual
feelings. The Great Gatsby, written by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald
(2013), is published in this period and often perceived as one of the Great
American Novel. Its success cannot be only attributed to the flowery language,
graceful style, and even the miserable plot, but the accurate captures of ethos
and the long-term effects on Americans. Therefore, this essay, concentrating on
the pursuit of American Dream and the depiction of social class in the Jazz Age,
will examine the reasons for its successful presentation via analysing the
symbolism and diction of this novel with reference to its cultural context.

**Symbolism**

The novel contains numerous objects with symbolic meanings; therefore, this
essay will elaborate on analysing the primary symbolism including the green
light, the car, the West Egg and East Egg, and the valley of ashes in The Great
Gatsby. The author draws an analogy between these objects and persons’ aims as
well as the stratum which accurately exhibit the circumstances in that time.

The green light suited at the end of Daisy’s dock, which mainly appears three
times, symbolizes the Gatsby's hope, his expectation and more generally American
Dream (Dowling, 2006). When that minute green light firstly depicted in the
novel, Nick discovered that Gatsby tremblingly stretched out his arms toward it
at dark night. In this section, the author draws an analogy between the only
illumination in the darkness and Gatsby’s dream in his life. Additionally, his
tremble implies the excitement and desire for that expectation which alludes the
contemporaries’ aspiration for the American Dream. In this respect, the Corpus
of Historical American English (2017) is employed to analyse the collocations of
‘green’ in order to detect the associational meaning of it in the 1910s and
1920s. This essay only chooses the noun collocations because grammatical terms
are typically the most frequent ones in texts and Palmer (2010) indicates that
these function words, which are less influencing in the content, can be excluded
in the language research.

Chart 2: the collocations of green listed by frequency in the 1920s

According to these two charts, the term ‘green’ is considered to be connected
with the objects with the characteristics of nature and life, for example, the
‘valley', ‘forest’, ‘grass’, and ‘meadows’. Therefore, the American Dream,
symbolised by the green light, harbours the features of vigour, vitality, and
possibilities which perceived to be held by nature. Furthermore, the description
of Nike’s recalling that “Gatsby believed in the green light, the organic future
that year by year recedes before us then…” also employs the term ‘organic’ to
reflect this theme. Referring to the Corpus of Historical American English
(2017), the collocations of ‘organic’ are comparatively assembling with that of
‘green’ such as ‘life’, ‘nature’, ‘evolution’, and ‘soil’. It seems like that
Fitzgerald displayed an immaculate and pure target which will never be
contaminated; However, Gatsby pursues Daisy, or the American Dream, by earning
fortune illegally, dishonestly and immorally which shows the corruption of it.
In this respect, the original sincere dream has been distorted with consumerism,
pragmatism, and utilitarianism as well. The car, additionally, is an important
symbolism which reveals almost all major characters’ pursuit of higher social
status and prosperity. Particularly for Gatsby, it is an identity of his
achievements and thing to attract Daisy back. This seemingly direct measure of
enhancing positions exaggerates this certain money worship. The author applies
these comparisons to imply the vigorous pursuit of the American Dream and the
contemporaries’ misunderstandings of this pure ideal.

Except those principal ones, there are multiple main symbolisms which indicate
the social class as well. The first one is the valley of ashes located between
West Egg and New York. The portrayal of its dinginess, chaos, and deformity
represents the quality of paupers’ life magnified by the extravagance of West
Egg and East Egg. This contrast manifests the American social condition in Jazz
Age when the poor lead a life of tribulation but the wealthy enjoy the arrogant,
dissolute, and sinful mode of life. Moreover, it may also satirise the young
generation, who neglected the poverty and evil in the society, indulged
themselves with the illimitable enjoyment of material consumption. Furthermore,
the West Egg and East Egg, which have the identical appearance but also a
dichotomy between them, symbolise the different social status as well.
Individuals who lived in the East Egg are considered to possess higher social
status as an aristocracy like Tom and Daisy. In contrast, Gatsby living in the
West Egg is depicted as a bounder, who is vulgar and garish, pretending to be
noble. This description shows the individuals’ enduring aspiration after
American Dream but the continual abortive consequences due to the serious
Matthew Effect. Additionally, the different traits harboured by those who reside
in these two Eggs illustrate the social situations as well. In the novel, Daisy,
presenting little compunction to it and even defaulting the funeral, evades the
responsibility and imputes to Gatsby about murdering Myrtle which caused
Gatsby’s death. Compared with the relatively virtuous Gatsby, the persons in the
East Egg are related to moral decay which becomes an analogy with the unethical,
selfish, and inconsiderate upper-class people. These presentations reveal the
tortuous social situations which produce a certain social discrimination in the
1920s.

**Diction**

Although the symbolism is adequately utilised to depict the social conditions in
that period, the diction of the novel is worth analysing because Fitzgerald uses
typical language to emphasise the impression on the splendour of American dream
and the cruel social class circumstances.

The portrayal of Daisy magnifies the beauty of her and therefore the
wonderfulness of American Dream. In the lines about Gatsby recalling his first
meet with Daisy, the commendatory terms are frequently used to display the
desire held by Gatsby. In the “There was a ripe mystery about it…and of dances
whose flowers were scarcely withered”, the non-restrictive attributive clauses
and conjunctions are employed to lead me to read it continuously which brings me
a feeling of nice eternal features will emerge. As Daisy symbolizes the American
Dream, it also triggers the readers’ longings for the beautiful ideal. However,
the author utilises a kind of poetic diction to perform description to present
the tragedy ending, for example, the line “She vanished into her rich house,
into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing”. In this line, the rhythm
changed because the feet altered from iambs to anapaests and ends with a
cacophony. It made me decrease the speed gradually and stop with an unpleasant
dissonant sound ‘nothing’ which guides me to generate a depressed mood. The
depiction which employing two different tones unintentionally brings the readers
the feelings of American Dream worthwhile to be pursued and the regret of
failure.

Furthermore, there are diverse expressions to allude the social class in that
period, for example, the elaborations on Gatsby’s luxurious party. The
‘enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names’
indicates the egoism by the high-class people which are also the declarations of
that in the real world. However, those who attend this party consider Gatsby as
a German spy during the war which shows their despising a newly rich. Moreover,
after analysing the frequency by the corpus software WordSmith 4, it is found
that the term ‘sport, which often collocates with ‘old’ to formulate a slang
which means ‘dude’, appears 47 times in the novel. It also alludes Gatsby’s
social class through his frequent exploit of that informal colloquialism because
analysing the language utilisation is conducive to examining people’s
personalities, status and social positions (Wodak and Meyer, 2016).
Additionally, in one dialogue, Tom says "All this 'old sport' business. Where'd
you pick that up?" to show his derision of Gatsby’s superficiality. These
descriptions illustrate the difficulties of the lower class entering higher
orders of society as well as the aristocrats’ contempt for the poor. It also
leads the readers to concentrate on considering the possibilities for Gatsby to
achieve success in that distorted society.

In conclusion, this essay has analysed the symbolism and diction, which perform
significant roles in capturing the ethos, of the Great Gatsby. This novel
depicts both the vigorous pursuit of the American Dream and the situations of
social class. In respect of the aspiration to the American Dream, Fitzgerald
draws considerable analogies between it and the plot. For instance, the green
light, which is regarded as an immaculate target, serves an essential symbolism
to that expectancy. Furthermore, the diction of the novel reveals it as well
such as the laudatory description of Daisy which brings readers the feelings of
desires to the ideal. For the conditions of social class, the author utilises
multiple symbolisms to reflect that theme such as the valley of ashes, West Egg
and East Egg. The diction in the novel magnifies it by depicting the dichotomy
of two types of life. They show a vivid life and social situations in the Jazz
Age and these elaborations are the principal factors of the Great Gatsby being
recognised as one of the Great American Novel. Additionally, the long-term
influence on the Americans is the other reason as well. This novel can be
regarded as a book which urges people to pursue the spectacular American Dream
but reminds people to select an appropriate way to it because it depicts an
imperfect but worth pursuing a dream and a tragedy of seeking for it by an
improper measure. Therefore, the Great Gatsby, succeeding in describing a
splendid history and an unforgettable period, will be famous in anticipatable
future and inspire people’s mind during a long span.
