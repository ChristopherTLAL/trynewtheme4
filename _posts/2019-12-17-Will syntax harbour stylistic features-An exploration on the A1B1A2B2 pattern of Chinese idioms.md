## Introduction

The cognitive mechanism of Chinese idiom processing has received scholarly
attention for decades (e.g. Mateu & Espinal, 2007; Nunberg, Sag, & Wasow, 1994).
This line of research focuses on the compositionality of idioms (e.g. Bobrow &
Bell, 1973; Swinney & Cutler, 1979; Gibbs & Colston, 2012; Cacciari and Tabossi,
1988). Some scholars claimed that *chengyu* (成语; one primary type of
four-character idiom in Chinese) is an entire meaning unit that does not follow
the typical syntactic structure of modern spoken Chinese (Moratto, 2010).
Dissimilarly, considerable empirical research also verified the hypothesis of
the hybrid model. For instance, employing Event-Related Potentials (ERPs),
Zhang, Yang, Gu, and Ji (2013) scrutinised the processing patterns of *chengyu*
and proved that language receivers comprehended the habitual idioms not only
based upon their long-term memories.

A small number of scholars are also interested in the syntactic aspects of
Chinese four-character idioms. The study from Zhang et al. (2013) has identified
a mature syntactic rule, that is, A1B1A2B2. This means two coordinate
compounding words, A1A2 and B1B2, were not simply conjoined to be A1A2B1B2 but
reorganised into the form of A1B1A2B2. For example, the habitual idiom
containing *diao qian* (调遣; move-send; deploy) and *bing jiang* (兵将;
soldiers-military commander; troops) is not *diao qian bing jiang* (调遣兵将,
move-send-soldiers-military commander; deploy troops) but *diao bing qian jiang*
(调兵遣将; move-solders-send-military commander, deploy troops). One recent
study also confirms the processing easiness of A1B1A2B2 compared to the
subject-predicate and the prosody-syntax mismatched idioms (see Bai, Xie, &
Feng, 2019 for more details). Unfortunately, almost no study has been conducted
on the real application of those identified syntaxes which is an important
aspect of language production and possibly second language acquisition.
Therefore, the present essay will assess the applicability of the syntax
‘A1A2B1B2 to A1B1A2B2’.

Besides the semantic and syntactic processing, some early works on Chinese
rhetorics also explored the stylistic feature of four-character idioms. Chinese
four-character idioms are believed to inherently harbour a formal register,
because (1) the quadrisyllabic structure reflect the aesthetic view of native
Chinese speakers (Chen, 2001 cited in Moratto, 2010); (2) the profound cultural
elements within the idioms exhibit the education level of the speakers; and (3)
the frequent utilisation in the Chinese literary texts constructs the prestige
of those idioms compared to the daily spoken language (Gunn, 1991). Nonetheless,
the studies on the style of idioms normally concentrate on the comparison
between well-established habitual idioms and unhabitual four-character
collocations. Differently, the present essay is interested in whether certain
syntactic structures (in this case, A1B1A2B2) has obtained the stylistic feature
of the original idioms and can also endow the self-invented idioms with this
specific style.

Therefore, this essay will primarily attempt to confirm the existence of the
syntactic rule A1B1A2B2, evaluate the applicability of this rule in different
constructions, and explore the stylistic features of it.

## Method

### Research Design

To confirm the existence of the syntactic rule A1B1A2B2., different from the
previous studies which only reviewed the habitual idioms in dictionaries, the
present essay will assess whether the self-invented A1B1A2B2 words are
intelligible to native Chinese speakers. Most of these terms are invented via
altering the purely compositional collocation A1A2B1B2 forms to the A1B1A2B2
ones. For instance, the term *ji mou shen yuan* (计谋深远;
plan-strategy-deep-far; plan foresightedly) will be transformed to *ji shen mou
yuan* (计深谋远; plan-deep-strategy-far; plan foresightedly) (see *Appendix A*
for more). If the speakers can understand the changed one, this ‘A1A2B1B2 to
A1B1A2B2’ rule then might be regarded as one of the mature grammatical rules of
Chinese idiom production.

Additionally, to explore the applicability of this rule in diverse
constructions, the author creates a series of A1B1A2B2 terms based on different
part of speech (PoS) patterns of two constituents A1A2 and B1B2 including *n*. +
*v.*, *v*. + *n*., *n*. + *adj*., *adj*. +*n*., *v*. + *v.*, *n.* + *n*., and
*adj*. +*adj*.. It should be noticed that the PoS here only represents the PoS
of the two disyllable constituents. For example, the pair *kuang wang* (狂妄;
crazy-absurd; outrageously arrogant) and *si xiang* (思想; speculate-think;
thinking) is regarded as *adj*. + *n*., even though after the reorganisation of
the word order *kuang si* (狂思; crazy-speculate; crazily imagine) can be
identified as a verb. It is acknowledged that these complicated conversions of
PoS may be sometimes neglected by the present essay due to the lack of a
meticulously detailed data. However, the result can still be recognised as a
valuable starting point for future research.

Moreover, if it is true that the base-form (normally A1A2B1B2) and the marked
form (A1B1A2B2) are almost the same in terms of their syllable structure
(quadrisyllable) and ideational meaning, the author is interested in that to
what extent they are different in the aspect of stylistic meaning. For example,
if *qian jia xi yuan* (迁家徙园; move-family-move-garden; move away from the
original place of residence) is semantically and phonologically similar to *qian
xi jia yuan* (迁徙家园; move-move-family-garden; move away from the original
place of residence), the stylistic difference of them may suggest that the
syntactic rule A1B1A2B2 *per se* has harboured specific stylistic feature. That
may become another line of research on Chinese idiom grammaticalisation.

To explore those hypotheses, both questionnaire-based survey and interview were
conducted. The first section of the questionnaire contains several 5-point items
asking the participants to rate the intelligibility of all the marked terms
(from ‘cannot understand’ to ‘understand immediately’), followed by a parallel
set of questions about the base-forms in the second section. The reason for
putting the marked terms first is that the author wants to avoid the
participants to interpret the marked items based on their completely
compositional original forms. The third section comprises a series of 9-point
items asking the participants to identify the formality for each term (from
‘vulgar speech’ to ‘solemn expression’). As a total of 32 terms will be
investigated, a detailed list of the explanation of each term may be lengthy to
present in the main text; therefore, comprehensive information will be attached
in *Appendix A* for reference, and the questionnaire will be shown in *Appendix
B*.

### Participants

The present study involves 21 right-handed Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University’s
undergraduate students who are attending ENG317 Chinese Linguistics. All the
participants reported that they are native Mandarin speakers, receiving
education over 10 years under Putonghua medium instruction. It is also confirmed
that the respondents have never suffered from any types of language disorders or
neurological impairment. Before the actual data collection, they are all
informed about their rights to terminate the survey. The anonymity of the
participants is ensured throughout the study.

## Results and Discussion

*The Existence of the Syntactic Rule A1B1A2B2*

Table 1 is the descriptive data of the intelligibility score of each item,
ranging from 1 to 5. The experimental group indicates the uncommon word order
(marked) and the control group represents the opposite (unmarked). In most
cases, the marked terms are of A1B1A2B2 pattern, but the first two rows
represent the habitual idioms with A1B1A2B2 base-forms and A1A2B1B2 marked forms
which will be in comparison with the others.

![](/9c795536ef896d36e8582b3808f3185e.png)

It could be noticed that the marked A1B1A2B2 pattern usually would not be
spotted as unintelligible. From Table 1, nearly 80% of the marked terms have an
intelligibility score over 4 (representing ‘understand with some efforts’ in the
questionnaire). In addition, in the interview, the participants demonstrated
that they hardly encountered difficulties when trying to decode those marked
terms. Also, some even claimed that they are able to ‘comprehend those group of
words holistically just like idioms’. It can be an evidence to show that
A1B1A2B2 has become a mature syntactic rule for Chinese idiom production.
However, from Table 1, it can be inferred that the applicability of this rule
indeed varies in different constructions.

### Applicability of the syntactic rule A1B1A2B2

To explore the applicability of this rule, the author chooses to observe to what
extent the intelligibility of marked terms differentiates according to different
PoS patterns of the constituents. However, it is not reliable to simply rank the
experimental group’s average score, because this score will fluctuate concerning
the intelligibility level of the base-forms. The *r*-value in Table 1, which
represents the magnitude of difference between the intelligibility of marked
forms and that of the completely compositional base-forms, can be indicative of
the applicability of this syntactic reformation. If the pairs exert an *r-*value
under .1[^1], the applicability of the ‘A1A2B1B2 to A1B1A2B2’ rule is extremely
high because no significant difference of intelligibility could be identified
between the experimental and control groups. In this respect, two terms were
found including *shi yi yong yao* (施医用药; execute-cure-use-medicine; use
medicine to cure people) and *kuang si wang xiang* (狂思妄想;
crazy-speculate-absurd-think; think in a frantic manner). Two participants said
that they to some extent resorted to the existing forms which contain the
similar word order such as *qiu yi wen yao* (求医问药; beg-cure-ask-medicine;
seek medical advice) and *qi si miao xiang* (奇思妙想;
odd-speculate-wonderful-think; wonderful thoughts). Therefore, it may be
concluded that this syntactic rule is most applicable to the newly invented term
which resembles the existing idiom.

[^1]: If inferential statistics were used, Cohen’s (2013) benchmark for effect
    size interpretation will be employed. Therefore, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 will be
    regarded as ‘small’, ‘medium’, and ‘large’ respectively for the *r*-based
    effect sizes. Also, as the study only involves 21 participants which does
    not have perfect statistical power, even the ‘small’ effect size will be
    regarded as a potentially important figure.

Apart from these two terms, Table 1 shows that the constructions generating the
*r*-values between .1 to .3 are usually *n. + v.*, *v. + n*., *n. + adj.*, *and
adj. + n*. formations. The four pairs of *n. + n.* and *adj. + adj.* formation
all produce the *r*-values over .3. Also, some surprising results can be
identified such as two *v. + v.* constructions generate .23 and .79 *r*-values
respectively. Some respondents reported that the high intelligibility of *lue
qin duo zhan* (掠侵夺占; ransack-invade-rob-encroach; ransack and encroach) is
solely due to the high semantic similarity among those four characters.
Therefore, *v. + v.* still seems to be a construction with low applicability of
the ‘A1A2B1B2 to A1B1A2B2’ rule. Based on the above findings, it is found that
constituents with different PoS (*n. + v.*, *v. + n*., *n. + adj.*, *and adj. +
n*.) are more possibly to use the A1B1A2B2 rule, but those with the same PoS
(*n. + n*., *adj. + adj.*, and *v. + v.*) are not perfectly compatible to this
rule. The author hypothesises that this may stem from the different
compositionality level of different constructions. Of the terms with different
PoS, the two parts (A1B1 and A2B2) may become endocentric compounds (e.g.
*subject + predicate*, *verb + object*, *head + postmodifier*, and *premodifier
+ head*), such as *shi yi* (施医; execute-cure; to cure people) and *yong yao*
(用药; use-medicine; to use medicine). In contrast, two characters with the same
PoS, unless they are synonyms, are more difficult to compound to be *coordinate
noun phrase*, *coordinate verb phrase*, or *serial verb constructions*.

In the interview, three respondents also reported that the semantic
reconstruction might hinder the processing of those marked terms and even change
the experiential meaning of the base-forms. For example, the modification on
*shen ti biao mian* (身体表面; body-body-surface-face; the surface of the body)
will produce a term containing an existing word *ti mian* (体面; body-face;
decent) which conflicts with the original meaning. This problem may be because
(1) Chinese is an analytical language regarding word order as an crucial
semantic device (Whaley, 1996), and (2) the new invented two-character terms may
be identical to one of the ubiquitous two-character compounds in Chinese by
accident (Arcodia, 2007). Therefore, one constraint for this syntactic rule is
that it should not be applied when the A1B1A2B2 structure contains an existing
term which is semantically different from the unmarked base-form.

### Stylistic meaning of the syntactic rule A1B1A2B2

It should be firstly pointed out that, as discussed earlier, the ideational
meaning of the A1A2B1B2 and A1B1A2B2 terms may not be identical, which means
that there might be other differences between these two groups apart from the
stylistic feature. However, if a general pattern of stylistic difference can be
identified, this is obviously a valuable starting point for future research.

![](/cf4bc35671dd8a88f7b70b22f683f498.png)

Table 2 presents the descriptive data of the perceived style of two groups of
terms. In some cases, the A1A2B1B2 terms which may be a daily usage (*Mean* =
4.62) such as *kuang wang si xiang* (狂妄思想; crazy-absurd-speculate-think;
think in a frantic manner) will become a formal speech (*Mean* = 6.48) when
changed into A1B1A2B2 form (*r* = .48). Using the effect size benchmark of Cohen
(2013), it could be concluded that, except *lue qin duo zhan* (掠侵夺占)[^2],
all the other A1B1A2B2 constructions are perceived to be significantly more
formal than the A1A2B1B2 ones. As mentioned before, the four characters of *lue
qin duo zhan* (掠侵夺占) are semantically similar which may hinder the
recognition of the A1B1A2B2 rule; therefore, the author may at this stage regard
this data as an outlier. In the interview, the respondents indicated that,
although they have never seen the terms in the experimental group before, those
words ‘sound pretty figurative, literary, and formal’. Some even believed that
the utilisation of these words could make them ‘look cool’. Both the
quantitative and qualitative data confirm that the A1B1A2B2 construction entails
a high register in the Chinese language.

[^2]: The literal and figurative meaning may not be provided to some
    aforementioned Chinese terms. If needed, *Appendix A* could be served as a
    reference.

Additionally, as sometimes defamiliarisation *per se* can trigger different
linguistic reaction (Shklovsky, 1917), the author used two originally A1B1A2B2
idioms, including *diao bing qian jiang* (调兵遣将) and *long zheng hu dou*
(龙争虎斗; dragon-compete-tiger-fight; a fierce struggle between two evenly
matched opponents), to show that changing them back to the A1A2B1B2 structures
does not enhance but significantly decrease their formality (*r* = -.49 and -.57
respectively), indicating that this stylistic difference does not derive from
only defamiliarising the base-forms.

Interestingly, in the interview, some respondents claimed that, when
encountering the marked forms (A1A2B1B2) of those originally A1B1A2B2 words,
they ‘automatically reorganise the order of the terms to understand it’ without
recognising those words as marked terms. It may support the hybrid model that
individuals will directly retrieve the meaning from long-term memory if based on
enough clues can they identify the term as a habitual idiom (Cacciari & Tabossi,
1988).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this essay examined the presence of A1B1A2B2 rule of Chinese
four-character idioms, the applicability of this rule, and the stylistic feature
held by this rule. Firstly, by investigating the intelligibility of several
self-invented A1B1A2B2 terms, the existence of this syntactic rule was
confirmed. Secondly, it is hypothesised that the applicability of this rule is
dependent on the compositionality level and their conflicts with the existing
terms. Thirdly, it is unveiled that the A1B1A2B2 term always harbours a more
formal register.

It seems that, during the grammaticalisation of the A1B1A2B2 pattern, the high
register of many Chinese idioms with this pattern has been integrated into this
syntactic rule. If it is true, the first contribution of the present essay is to
expand our understanding of grammaticalisation. This preliminary exploration
should be consolidated by more cognitive or even neurolinguistic research. In
addition, the model for idiom processing may be enhanced based on our results
because a new variable (i.e. stylistic feature of syntax) should be added.
Limited by length, the present essay will only present the findings of this
empirical research, and the construction of a new theoretical framework may be
elaborated in the future.

Three principal limitations exist for the present study. The findings cannot be
generalised to a broader community of Chinese speakers, due to the limited
representative of the well-educated multilingual participants who are receiving
tertiary education at the time of the survey. Also, restrained by time and
coursework requirement, the sample size cannot be larger which is of utmost
importance in quantitative empirical research (Field, 2013). Finally, the
self-invented terms only covered a small number of possible constructions,
restricting the range and depth of interpretation. However, this research can be
served as a valuable exploratory study which requires further replications.
