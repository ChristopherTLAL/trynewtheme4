After enacting the legislation about homosexual marriage in multiple countries,
the meanings of term ‘marriage’, ‘husband’, and ‘wife’ have changed gradually.
In linguistics, the phenomenon that the signification of word alters
continuously is regarded as the semantic change (Saeed, 2000). This essay will
concentrate on the lexical variation on the expression ‘nice’, which meaning has
shifted to be opposite from 12th century to status quo, from four constituents
including sense changing, collocation comparison, semantic feature analysis, and
associative meaning shifting.

The sense of the term ‘nice’ has changed throughout the history. In the 12th
century, “careless, stupid, and weak” is the definition of nice in old French
from Latin word ‘nescius’ which suggests ‘ignorant’ (Onions, 2006). For
ignorance, the sense from my perspective is an illiterate and uncultivated
individual. In Compact Oxford English Dictionary (Soanes & Hawker, n.d.),
however, the recent meaning of ‘nice’ is ‘pleasant, kind, enjoyable’ which
endows this word with a dissimilar sense to people. When mentioning ‘nice’, I
will consider it a commendatory word and associate it with the sense ‘attractive
entity’ or the emotion ‘cheerful’.

The collocation of 'nice' can corroborate the sense switching as well.
Shakespeare, W. (2013) wrote ‘nice wenches’ which connote ‘disreputable women’
in Love’s Labour Lost in 15th century. However, referring to the Oxford
Collocations Dictionary for Students of English (Crowther, Dignen & Lea, 2008),
the ‘perfectly nice’, ‘nice atmosphere’, and ‘nice bonus’ suggest the
interpretation of ‘pleasant, kind’ which are regarded as the commendatory
meanings recently. Furthermore, the using of corpus will enhance the accuracy of
the result because the frequency ordering and collocations recorded in corpus
will indicate the real usage (Thomas & Short, 2001). In the column of ‘Nice’ in
the Corpus of Contemporary American English built by Davies, M. (2008), the
frequently utilised collocations contain ‘nice lady’, ‘nice meet’, ‘nice
polite’, and ‘nice guy’ which all reveal the commendatory perspectives of this
term recently.

Additionally, the semantic feature-analyses, and feature-based etymologies,
which are conducive in understanding the denotations from subdivided
characteristics, have been applied in considerable circumstances (Saeed, 2000).
Nevertheless, multiple features of words, which are from the historical or
accidental factors, causes utilising this research strategy unreliable in
etymology because diverse ones are added or abolished which cannot suggest the
changing process of meaning (Sweetser, 2001). Therefore, the semantic feature
analysing sheet will be devised according to the etymology in order to
illustrate the semantic shifting process. Introduced by Onions (2006), there are
three steps in the meaning change of ‘nice’. Firstly, the meaning of ‘stupid’
expanded to that of ‘fastidious’. Furthermore, many individuals consider
‘fastidious’ as ‘precise, careful’. Finally, the recent meaning which indicate
‘delightful, kind’ appears.

*semantic feature analysing sheet*

Resembling with the instances above, in majority sentences in the spoken English
recorded by Corpus of Contemporary American English established by Davies, M.
(2008), the ‘nice’ expresses ‘pleasant, good’ which is similar to its
conventional meaning. However, there are also manifold different associated
meanings of it. For instance, in the sentence ‘I tided the room to make it nice
to for the others when they came home.’, it actually signifies that ‘to make it
comfortable and clean’ (Crowther, Dignen & Lea, 2008). This can show the common
perceptions of this word recently and reveal the usage difference of it as well.

In conclusion, this essay has analysed the semantic change of the word ‘nice’ by
explaining the sense alteration, comparing the collocations, analysing the
semantic features, and enumerating several associated meanings. Examining the
semantic shift is worthwhile because it will illustrate diverse social
transformation. In the future, hopefully, the investigation of semantics and
etymology will apply more on evaluating the social circumstances.
