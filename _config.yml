title: The Linguist
description: "The Linguist is held by Shijie [ʂʅ51 tɕjɛ35] Wang who graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University with a bachelor’s degree in Applied English (First Class). My main research area is psycholinguistics, and I research the dynamic relationship between language acquisition and individual differences variables such as personality traits, emotions, and digital literacy.<p>I am particularly interested in the empowerment of language learners. For instance, specific attention was paid to the paradigm of ‘good language learner’ (GLL) in which the researchers and practitioners incline to identify the features of being a GLL which entails an inherent and implicit discrimination on the ‘bad language learner’.</p>"
